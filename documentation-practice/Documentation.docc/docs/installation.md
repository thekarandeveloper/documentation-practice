# Installation Guide

This guide covers how to set up the project using Android Studio.

## Cloning the Repository

We use Android Studio's built-in version control tools to manage the project.

1. Open **Android Studio**.
2. If you are on the Welcome screen, click on **Get from VCS** (or **Check out project from Version Control**).
3. If you already have a project open, go to **File > New > Project from Version Control...**.
4. In the "Get from Version Control" dialog:
   - Ensure **Version control** is set to `Git`.
   - In the **URL** field, enter the repository URL:
     ```
     https://github.com/swipe-YC21/swipe-ios.git
     ```
   - Choose a **Directory** where you want to save the project.
5. Click **Clone**.

## Opening the Project

Once the cloning process is complete, Android Studio will ask if you want to open the project. Click **Yes** (or **Trust Project** if prompted).

## Building and Running

While this is an iOS project, if you are using Android Studio for specific workflows as configured by the team, follow the specific run configurations provided in the project workspace settings.
